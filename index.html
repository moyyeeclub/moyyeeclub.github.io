								<p>The Moy Yee Kung Fu Club has been an established club at Columbia University for nearly two decades. The club is led by Sifu David Yee Pak, senior-level disciple of globally respected Grandmaster Henry Moy Yee of the lineage of Bruce Lee's legendary teacher, Yip Man. The club offers training in Wing Chun and Tai-Chi, two complementary kung fu systems which provide a rounded martial arts education, as well as health and fitness benefits.</p>
								<p>No experience is necessary to join the club. We welcome everyone from students to faculty to alumni, as well as those unaffiliated with Columbia. If you are interested in the club, we invite you to try two practices for free!</p>
								<p>Practices are on Mondays and Fridays on the Columbia campus and include forms, mitt and pad work, and hand-to-hand drills.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Monday: CEPSR Lobby, 7:00-9:00pm</li>
									<li>Friday: Schapiro Lounge, 7:00-9:00pm</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Come for the self-defense and meditation, and stay for the good time!</p>

									<h3>Martial Arts</h3>
								<p>Wing Chun is a traditional kung fu style that focuses on close range combat. The core principles are the conservation of time, distance, and energy. The style is said to have been created hundreds of years ago by a nun named Ng Mui and named after her female student Yim Wing Chun, and is known as a system that can be well-utilized against bigger, stronger opponents. Notable practitioners of Wing Chun include Bruce Lee and Robert Downey Jr.</p>
								<p>Tai Chi is an ancient martial arts tradition originally developed for self-defense and now commonly used for health benefits and stress reduction. Often described as meditation in motion, this style has been cited by several studies as an effective method of increasing energy, balance, and muscle strength, as well as enhancing quality of sleep, the immune system, and overall well-being.</p>
								<h3>Instructor</h3>
								<p><a href="https://www.yeepakkungfu.com/">Sifu David Yee Pak</a> has studied Ving Tsun, Tai Chi (Yang and Chen styles), weaponry, Shaolin Fist, and the kung fu lifestyle under Grandmaster Henry Moy Yee since 2000. He has served as a Senior Instructor at the Moy Yee Kung Fu headquarters in Brooklyn as well as at the Moy Yee Kung Fu Club at Columbia University for fifteen years. Sifu Yee Pak was a judge during Moy Yee San Jong promotion tests as well as Siu Lim Tau competitions. He has assisted Grandmaster Moy Yee during seminars in Brooklyn College and St. Joseph's College. Sifu Yee Pak's other martial arts experiences include Tae Kwon Do, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and Muay Thai. He is also a certified personal trainer under the National Academy of Sports Medicine.</p>
